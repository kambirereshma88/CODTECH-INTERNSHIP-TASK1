EDA 
Diwali Sales Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of Diwali sales data to uncover key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, 
and profitability during the Diwali season. The dataset includes information on various sales transactions, customer demographics, and product categories.

Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:

To understand the sales distribution across different product categories.
To analyze customer behavior based on demographic information like gender and region.
To identify high-performing regions and products.
To evaluate profitability by comparing sales and profit margins.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:

Product Category: The category of the product sold (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.).
Sales: The total sales amount for the product.
Profit: The profit earned from the product.
State: The region or state where the sale occurred.
Customer Name: The name of the customer who made the purchase.
Gender: The gender of the customer.
Quantity: The number of items sold in each transaction.

Key Insights & Findings
Top-performing Categories:

Electronics contributed the highest sales during the Diwali season, followed by Clothing and Home Appliances.
Regional Performance:

Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were the top-performing states in terms of total sales. However, Maharashtra generated higher profits compared to Uttar Pradesh, 
which had significant sales but lower profit margins.
Customer Behavior:

Female customers contributed to a larger portion of sales in certain categories like Clothing, while male customers had higher spending in Electronics.
Profitability Trends:

Products with higher sales in certain regions did not always result in higher profits.
For example, discounted products saw a rise in quantity sold but a decrease in profit margins.


Analysis Techniques
The following techniques and tools were used to analyze the data:

Data Cleaning: Missing data was handled, and duplicates were removed to ensure clean data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualization techniques were applied, including bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps, 
using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Pivot Tables: To summarize and aggregate sales data across categories, regions, and customer demographics.
Correlation Analysis: To identify relationships between sales, profit, and other variables like product category and region.


Tools & Libraries Used
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: To load and manipulate the dataset.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating various plots and visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: The environment used for performing the analysis and documenting the steps.


Challenges Faced
Missing Data: Some entries in the profit column were missing, which were filled using the average profit values of respective product categories.
Outliers: Some regions had extreme sales values, which were addressed by normalizing the data to ensure a more accurate comparison across regions.


Conclusion & Recommendations
Regional Focus: Focus on regions like Maharashtra for targeted marketing campaigns.
Product Strategy: Offering higher discounts on non-electronic products like Clothing could drive more sales while maintaining healthy profit margins.
Customer Segmentation: Identifying trends based on customer gender and age could help tailor product offerings more effectively during festive seasons.


This analysis provides actionable insights to drive sales and improve strategies for future Diwali seasons.
